# Welcome to PacketLab!

### PacketLab (pktlab) is a new measurement endpoint interface designed to facilitate endpoint sharing among the network measurement research community.

To try out our software package, including a reference PacketLab endpoint, experiment running utilities, and some example measurement applets, see [Downloads](/download/) and [Tutorials](/tutorial/). For documentation of the `libpktlab` utility library, see [Docs](/docs/). To learn more about PacketLab, see [About](/about/).

*TBA: geo location of active endpoint and controller on map*

> The PacketLab project is supported by NSF grant #1764055.
