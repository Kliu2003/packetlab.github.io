It enables researchers (experiment controllers) to easily send and receive network data from the endpoints. So they can perform experiments without installing new software on the endpoint. On top of that, PacketLab offers a fine-grained access control model for the endpoint operators, making them more willing to share their computers with the community.

We are looking to port the existing prototype running on Linux to more operating systems, allowing more endpoint operators to participate in the ecosystem.
