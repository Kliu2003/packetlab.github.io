PacketLab is built on two key ideas: It moves the measurement logic out of the endpoint to a separate experiment control server, making each endpoint a lightweight packet source/sink. At the same time, it provides a way to delegate access to measurement endpoints while retaining fine-grained control over how endpoints are used by others, allowing research groups to share measurement infrastructure with little overhead.

We are looking to port the existing prototype to more operating systems, allowing more endpoint operators to participate in the ecosystem.
